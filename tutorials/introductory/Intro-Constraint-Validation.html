    <title>Integrity Constraints and Data Validation</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>For detecting non-admissible and inconsistent data and for
  preventing such data to be added to an application's database, we need to
  define suitable <strong><em>integrity constraints </em></strong> that can be
  used by the application's <strong><em>data validation</em></strong>
  mechanisms for catching these cases of flawed data. Integrity constraints
  are logical conditions that must be satisfied by the data entered by a user
  and stored in the application's database.</p><p>For instance, if an
  application is managing data about persons including their birth dates and
  their death dates, then we must make sure that for any person record with a
  death date, this date is not before that person's birth date.</p><p>Since
  <em>integrity maintenance</em> is fundamental in database management, the
  <em>data definition language</em> part of the <em>relational database
  language SQL</em> supports the definition of integrity constraints in
  various forms. On the other hand, however, there is hardly any support for
  integrity constraints and data validation in common programming languages
  such as Python, Java, C# or JavaScript. It is therefore important to take a
  systematic approach to constraint validation in web application engineering,
  like choosing an application development framework that provides sufficient
  support for it.</p><p>Unfortunately, many web application development
  frameworks do not provide sufficient support for defining integrity
  constraints and performing data validation. Integrity constraints should be
  defined in one (central) place in an app, and then be used for configuring
  the user interface and for validating data in different parts of the app,
  such as in the user interface code and in the data storage code. In terms of
  usability, the goals should be:</p><ol>
      <li><p>To prevent the user from entering invalid data in the user
      interface (UI) by limiting the input options, if possible.</p></li>

      <li><p>To detect and reject invalid user input as early as possible by
      performing constraint validation in the UI for those UI widgets where
      invalid user input cannot be prevented by limiting the input
      options.</p></li>

      <li><p>To prevent that invalid data pollutes the app's main memory state
      and persistent database state by performing constraint validation also
      in the model layer and in the data storage layer.</p></li>
    </ol><p>HTML5 provides support for validating user input in an
  HTML-forms-based user interface (UI). Here, the goal is to provide immediate
  feedback to the user whenever invalid data has been entered into a form
  field. This UI mechanism of <em><strong>responsive validation</strong></em>
  is an important feature of modern web applications. In traditional web
  applications, the back-end component validates the data and returns the
  validation results in the form of a set of error messages to the front-end.
  Only then, often several seconds later, and in the hard-to-digest form of a
  bulk message, does the user get the validation
  feedback.</p><p><dfn>Integrity constraints</dfn> (or simply
  <em>constraints</em>) are logical conditions on the data of an app. They may
  take many different forms. The most important type of constraints,
  <strong><em>property constraints</em></strong>, define conditions on the
  admissible property values of an object. They are defined for an object type
  (or class) such that they apply to all objects of that type. Some of the
  most important cases of property constraints are:</p><dl>
      <dt><strong>Range Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that an attribute must have a value from the value space
      of the type that has been defined as its range. For instance, in the
      following definition of the property "title", its range is defined as
      "NonEmptyString", which means that its values must be non-empty
      strings:</p><pre>Book.<b>properties</b> = {  
  "title": {<b>range</b>:"NonEmptyString", label:"Title"},
}</pre></dd>

      <dt><strong>String Length Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that the length of a string value for an attribute is
      less than a certain maximum number, or greater than a minimum number.
      String length constraints are defined with the fields <code>min</code>
      and <code>max</code> in a property definition:</p><pre>Book.<b>properties</b> = {  
  "title": {range:"NonEmptyString", label:"Title", <b>min</b>: 2, <b>max</b>: 50},
}</pre></dd>

      <dt><strong>Mandatory Value Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that a property must have a value. For instance, a book
      must have a title, so the "title" attribute is defined to be mandatory
      In OEMjs, all properties are mandatory by default. A property is only
      non-mandatory, if it is defined to be optional, as in the following
      example:</p><pre>Book.<b>properties</b> = {  
  "edition": {range:"PositiveInteger", label:"Edition", <b>optional</b>: true},
}</pre></dd>

      <dt><strong>Interval Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that the value of a numeric attribute must be in a
      specific interval, which defined with the fields <code>min</code> and
      <code>max</code>:</p><pre>Book.<b>properties</b> = {  
  "year": {range:"Integer", label:"Year", <b>min</b>: 1459, <b>
           max</b>: () =&gt; (new Date()).getFullYear()+1},
}</pre><p>Notice that in this example, the value of the <code>max</code> field
      is a function that computes the next year.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Pattern Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that a string attribute's value must match a certain
      pattern defined by a regular expression. The pattern is defined with the
      field <code>pattern</code>, and the error message to be displayed in the
      case of a pattern violation is defined with the field
      <code>patternMessage</code>:</p><pre>Book.<b>properties</b> = {
  "isbn": {range:"String", label:"ISBN", <b>pattern</b>:/\b\d{9}(\d|X)\b/,
    <b>patternMessage</b>:"The ISBN must be a 9-digit string followed by 'X'!"},
}</pre></dd>

      <dt><strong>Cardinality Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>apply to multi-valued properties, only, and require that the
      cardinality of a multi-valued property's value set is not less than a
      given minimum cardinality or not greater than a given maximum
      cardinality.</p><pre>Person.<b>properties</b> = {  
  "phoneNumbers": {range:"NonEmptyString", label:"Phone numbers", 
                   <b>minCard</b>: 1, <b>maxCard</b>: Infinity},
}</pre><p>Using the special value <code>Infinity</code> as the value of the
      <code>maxCard</code> field means that the size of the property's value
      set is unbounded.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Standard ID Constraints (also called 'Primary Key
      Constraints')</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that a property's value is mandatory and unique among all
      instances of the given object type. They are defined with the help of
      the field <code>isIdAttribute</code>:</p><pre>Book.<b>properties</b> = {
  "isbn": {range:"String", <b>isIdAttribute</b>: true, label:"ISBN"},
}</pre></dd>
    </dl></body>
