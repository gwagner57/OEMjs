  <body><p>For setting up an OEMjs app, you have to write</p><ol>
      <li>a class module file for each of the business object types of your
      app;</li>

      <li>an <kbd>app.mjs</kbd> module file for creating an <code>app</code>
      object that includes a definition of test data;</li>

      <li>an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file for being able to run your app in a
      browser.</li>
    </ol><p>For all three types of files, you may use a copy from one of the
  example apps as your model or starting point.</p><h3>The class module file
  <kbd>Book.mjs</kbd></h3><p>The "Book Data Management" app has one class
  module <kbd>Book.mjs</kbd> for defining the business object class
  <i>Book</i>:</p><pre class="role-listing-1">import bUSINESSoBJECT from "../../../src/bUSINESSoBJECT.mjs";
import {dt} from "../../../src/datatypes.mjs";

class <b>Book</b> extends bUSINESSoBJECT {
  constructor ({isbn, title, year, edition, purchaseDate, 
      recordCreatedOn=new Date(), isReserved=false}) {
    <b>super</b>( <b>isbn</b>);
    this.title = title;
    this.year = year;
    if (edition) this.edition = edition;
    this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate;
    this.recordCreatedOn = recordCreatedOn;
    this.isReserved = isReserved;
  }
}
Book.<b>properties</b> = {
  "isbn": {range:"String", label:"ISBN", ...},
  "title": {range:"NonEmptyString", label:"Title", ...},
  "year": {range:"Integer", label:"Year", ...},
  "edition": {range:"PositiveInteger", label:"Edition", ...},
  "purchaseDate": {range:"Date", label:"Purchase date", ...},
  "recordCreatedOn": {range:"DateTime", label:"Record created on", ...},
  "isReserved": {range: "Boolean", label:"Is reserved"}
}
Book.<b>displayAttribute</b> = "title";
// collect business object classes in a map
dt.classes["Book"] = Book;

export default Book;</pre><p>For any other business object class, the same
  code sections are needed. In particular, you need to define your business
  object classes by extending the pre-defined OEMjs class
  <code>bUSINESSoBJECT</code>, which defines an ID attribute, implying that in
  the constructor of the subclass you need to invoke <code>super</code> with
  the ID constructor parameter of the subclass. In the example code above,
  since the ID attribute of the Book class is "isbn", we have the invocation
  <code>super(isbn)</code>.</p><p>Notice that the properties of a class are
  not only defined in the constructor function (where they are assigned), but
  also in the property definitions map <code>Book.properties</code> which
  includes a definition record for each property, defining a <em>range</em>
  and a <em>label</em> for them. The property definitions are not fully shown
  above, indicated by "...", which stands for the missing property constraint
  definitions. A complete discussion of property constraints is provided in
  the next section.</p><p>Suitable range constraints can be defined by using
  one of the supported range keywords listed below.</p><ul>
      <li>"String", "NonEmptyString", "Identifier", "Email", "URL",
      "PhoneNumber"</li>

      <li>"Integer", "PositiveInteger", "NonNegativeInteger",
      "AutoNumber"</li>

      <li>"Decimal", "Number", "Percent", "ClosedUnitInterval",
      "OpenUnitInterval"</li>

      <li>"Boolean"</li>

      <li>"Date", "DateTime"</li>
    </ul><h3>The <kbd>app.mjs</kbd> module file</h3><p>For the simple "Book
  Data Management" app in the folder <kbd>apps/minimal/</kbd>, the
  <kbd>js/app.mjs</kbd> module has the following content:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-1">// import the app's business object classes
import Book from "./Book.mjs";
// import the required framework classes
import sTORAGEmANAGER from "../../../src/storage/sTORAGEmANAGER.mjs";
import bUSINESSaPP from "../../../src/bUSINESSaPP.mjs";
// create the app object
const <b>app</b> = new bUSINESSaPP({title:"Minimal OEMjs App",
    storageManager: new sTORAGEmANAGER({<b>adapterName</b>:"IndexedDB", 
        dbName:"MinApp", createLog: true, validateBeforeSave: true})
});<br />// set up the app<b>
app</b>.<b>setup</b>();
// define test data<b>
</b>Book.<b>testData</b> = [
  {isbn:"0553345842", title:"The Mind's I", year: 1982, ...},
  {isbn:"1463794762", title:"The Critique of Pure Reason", ...},
  {isbn:"1928565379", title:"The Critique of Practical Reason", ...},
  {isbn:"0465030793", title:"I Am A Strange Loop", ...}
];
// export the app object
export default app;</pre><p>For any other app, the same code sections are
  needed in <kbd>app.mjs</kbd>. Notice that in the creation of the business
  app object in lines 7-9, a storage manager is specified with an
  <i>adapterName</i> parameter set to "IndexedDB", which refers to the
  browser's built-in local storage technology. The <i>IndexedDB</i> storage
  option is always available and does not require any special setup. In
  addition to "IndexedDB", OEMjs will also support remote storage
  technologies, especially cloud storage technologies such as Google's
  FireStore or Cloudflare's D1.</p><h3>The <kbd>index.html</kbd>
  file</h3><p>Any web application is started by loading a web page that loads
  its code and provides its user interface. It is common to use the name
  "index.html" for this app start page.</p><pre class="role-listing-1">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"/&gt;
  ...
  &lt;script type="module"&gt;
    import vIEW from "../../src/ui/vIEW.mjs";
    import app from "./js/app.mjs";
    window.addEventListener("load", vIEW.setupUI( app) );
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  ...
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>The HTML <code>head</code> element contains a
  <code>script</code> element, in which first the framework library
  <kbd>vIEW.mjs</kbd> and then the <kbd>app.mjs</kbd> module described above
  is loaded, followed by adding an event listener that calls the user
  interface setup procedure <code>vIEW.setupUI</code>.after the HTML document
  has been loaded.</p></body>
