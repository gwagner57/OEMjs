    <title>Integrity Constraints</title>
  </head>

  <body><p><dfn>Integrity constraints</dfn> (or simply <em>constraints</em>)
  are logical conditions on the data of an app. They may take many different
  forms. The most important type of constraints, <strong><em>property
  constraints</em></strong>, define conditions on the admissible property
  values of an object. They are defined for an object type (or class) such
  that they apply to all objects of that type. We concentrate on the most
  important cases of property constraints:</p><dl>
      <dt><strong>String Length Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that the length of a string value for an attribute is
      less than a certain maximum number, or greater than a minimum
      number.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Mandatory Value Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that a property must have a value. For instance, a person
      must have a name, so the name attribute must not be empty.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Range Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that an attribute must have a value from the value space
      of the type that has been defined as its range. For instance, an integer
      attribute must not have the value "aaa".</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Interval Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that the value of a numeric attribute must be in a
      specific interval.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Pattern Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that a string attribute's value must match a certain
      pattern defined by a regular expression.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Cardinality Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>apply to multi-valued properties, only, and require that the
      cardinality of a multi-valued property's value set is not less than a
      given minimum cardinality or not greater than a given maximum
      cardinality.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Uniqueness Constraints (also called 'Key
      Constraints')</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that a property's value is unique among all instances of
      the given object type.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Referential Integrity Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that the values of a reference property refer to an
      existing object in the range of the reference property.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Frozen Value Constraints</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>require that the value of a property must not be changed after it
      has been assigned initially.</p></dd>
    </dl><p>The visual language of UML class diagrams supports defining
  integrity constraints either in a special way for special cases (like with
  predefined keywords), or, in the general case, with the help of
  <em>invariants</em>, which are conditions expressed either in plain English
  or in the <em><a href="#aside-ocl"
  title="Object Constraint Language   (OCL)">Object Constraint Language
  (OCL)</a></em> and shown in a special type of rectangle attached to the
  model element concerned. We use UML class diagrams for modeling constraints
  in <em>design models</em> that are independent of a specific programming
  language or technology platform.</p><aside id="aside-ocl"><h3>OCL</h3><p>The
  <em>Object Constraint Language</em> (OCL) was defined in 1997 as a formal
  logic language for expressing integrity constraints in UML version 1.1.
  Later, it was extended for allowing to define also (1) derivation
  expressions for defining derived properties, and (2) preconditions and
  postconditions for operations, in a class model.</p></aside><p>UML class
  diagrams provide special support for expressing multiplicity (or
  cardinality) constraints. This type of constraint allows to specify a lower
  multiplicity (minimum cardinality) or an upper multiplicity (maximum
  cardinality), or both, for a property or an association end. In UML, this
  takes the form of a multiplicity expression <code>l..u</code> where the
  lower multiplicity <code>l</code> is a non-negative integer and the upper
  multiplicity <code>u</code> is either a positive integer not smaller than
  <code>l</code> or the special value <code>*</code> standing for
  <em>unbounded</em>. For showing property multiplicity (or cardinality)
  constrains in a class diagram, multiplicity expressions are enclosed in
  brackets and appended to the property name, as shown in the
  <code>Person</code> class rectangle below.</p><p>In the following sections,
  we discuss the different types of property constraints listed above in more
  detail. We also show how to express some of them in computational languages
  such as <em>UML</em> class diagrams, <em>SQL</em> table creation statements,
  <em>JavaScript</em> model class definitions, or the annotation-based
  languages <em>Java Bean Validation</em> annotations and <em>ASP.NET Data
  Annotations</em>.</p><p>Any systematic approach to constraint validation
  also requires to define a set of error (or 'exception') classes, including
  one for each of the standard property constraints listed
  above.</p><section><h3>String Length Constraints</h3><p>The length of a
  string value for a property such as the title of a book may have to be
  constrained, typically rather by a maximum length, but possibly also by a
  minimum length. In an SQL table definition, a maximum string length can be
  specified in parenthesis appended to the SQL datatype <code>CHAR</code> or
  <code>VARCHAR</code>, as in <code>VARCHAR(50)</code>.</p><p>UML does not
  define any special way of expressing string length constraints in class
  diagrams. Of course, we always have the option to use an <em>invariant</em>
  for expressing any kind of constraint, but it seems preferable to use a
  simpler form of expressing these property constraints. One option is to
  append a maximum length, or both a minimum and a maximum length, in
  parenthesis to the datatype name, like so </p><figure> <img
  alt="Class Book with String Length Constraints"
  src="../fig/Book_withStringLengthConstraint_1.svg"
  width="180" /></figure><p>Another option is to use min/max constraint
  keywords in the property modifier list:</p><figure> <img
  alt="Class Book with String Length Constraints"
  src="../fig/Book_withStringLengthConstraint_2.svg" width="240" />
  </figure></section><section><h3>Mandatory Value Constraints</h3><p>A
  <em>mandatory value constraint</em> requires that a property must have a
  value. This can be expressed in a UML class diagram with the help of a
  multiplicity constraint expression where the lower multiplicity is 1. For a
  single-valued property, this would result in the multiplicity expression
  <code>1..1</code>, or the simplified expression <code>1</code>, appended to
  the property name in brackets. For example, the following class diagram
  defines a mandatory value constraint for the property <code>name</code>:
  </p><figure> <img alt="Class diagram with Mandatory Value Constraints"
  src="../fig/Person_ExampleModel.svg" width="180" /></figure><p>Whenever a
  class rectangle does not show a multiplicity expression for a property, the
  property is mandatory (and single-valued), that is, the multiplicity
  expression <code>1</code> is the default for properties.</p><p>In an SQL
  table creation statement, a mandatory value constraint is expressed in a
  table column definition by appending the key phrase <code>NOT NULL</code> to
  the column definition as in the following example:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-sql-tab2">CREATE TABLE persons(
  name  VARCHAR(30) <strong>NOT NULL</strong>,
  age   INTEGER
)</pre><p>According to this table definition, any row of the
  <code>persons</code> table must have a value in the column
  <code>name</code>, but not necessarily in the column
  <code>age</code>.</p><p>In JavaScript, we can code a mandatory value
  constraint by a class-level check function that tests if the provided
  argument evaluates to a value, as illustrated in the following
  example:</p><pre class="role-listing-javascript-tab2">Person.checkName = function (n) {
  if (<strong>n ===</strong> undefined) {
    return "A name must be provided!"; // constraint violation error message
  } else return "";  // no constraint violation
};</pre><p>With Java Bean Validation, a mandatory property like
  <code>name</code> is annotated with <code>NotNull</code> in the following
  way:</p><pre class="role-listing-java-tab2">@Entity
public class Person {
  <strong>@NotNull</strong>
  private String name;
  private int age;
}</pre><p>The equivalent ASP.NET Data Annotation is <code>Required</code> as
  shown in</p><pre class="role-listing-php-tab2">public class Person {
  [<strong>Required</strong>]
  public string name { get; set; }
  public int age { get; set; }
}</pre></section><section><h3>Range Constraints</h3><p>A range constraint
  requires that a property must have a value from the value space of the type
  that has been defined as its range. This is implicitly expressed by defining
  a type for a property as its range. For instance, the attribute
  <code>age</code> defined for the object type <code>Person</code> in the
  class diagram above has the range <code>Integer</code>, so it must not have
  a value like "aaa", which does not denote an integer. However, it may have
  values like -13 or 321, which also do not make sense as the age of a person.
  In a similar way, since its range is <code>String</code>, the attribute
  <code>name</code> may have the value "" (the empty string), which is a valid
  string that does not make sense as a name.</p><p>We can avoid allowing
  negative integers like -13 as age values, and the empty string as a name, by
  assigning more specific datatypes as range to these attributes, such as
  <code>NonNegativeInteger</code> to <code>age</code>, and
  <code>NonEmptyString</code> to <code>name</code>. Notice that such more
  specific datatypes are neither predefined in SQL nor in common programming
  languages, so we have to implement them either in the form of user-defined
  types, as supported in SQL-99 database management systems such as
  PostgreSQL, or by using suitable additional constraints such as <em>interval
  constraints</em>, which are discussed in the next section. In a UML class
  diagram, we can simply define <code>NonNegativeInteger</code> and
  <code>NonEmptyString</code> as custom datatypes and then use them in the
  definition of a property, as illustrated in the following diagram:
  </p><figure> <img alt="Class Diagram with Range Constraints"
  src="../fig/Person_ExampleModelWithCustomPropertyRange.svg" width="250" />
  </figure><p>In JavaScript, we can code a range constraint by a check
  function, as illustrated in the following example:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-javascript-tab2">Person.checkName = function (n) {
  if (typeof(n) !== "string" || n.trim() === "") {
    return "Name must be a non-empty string!";
  } else return "";
};</pre><p>This check function detects and reports a constraint violation if
  the given value for the <code>name</code> property is not of type "string"
  or is an empty string.</p><p>In a Java EE web app, for declaring empty
  strings as non-admissible user input we must set the context parameter
  <code>javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL </code> to
  <code>true</code> in the web deployment descriptor file
  <code>web.xml</code>.</p><p>In ASP.NET, empty strings are non-admissible by
  default.</p></section><section><h3>Interval Constraints</h3><p>An interval
  constraint requires that an attribute's value must be in a specific
  interval, which is specified by a minimum value or a maximum value, or both.
  Such a constraint can be defined for any attribute having an ordered type,
  but normally we define them only for numeric datatypes or calendar
  datatypes. For instance, we may want to define an interval constraint
  requiring that the <code>age</code> attribute value must be in the interval
  [25,70]. In a class diagram, we can define such a constraint by using the
  property modifiers <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>, as shown for the
  <code>age</code> attribute of the <code>Driver</code> class in the following
  diagram.</p><figure> <img alt="Class Diagram with Interval Constraints"
  src="../fig/Driver_ExampleModelWithIntervalConstraint.svg"
  width="250" /></figure><p>In an SQL table creation statement, an interval
  constraint is expressed in a table column definition by appending a suitable
  <code>CHECK</code> clause to the column definition as in the following
  example: </p><pre class="role-listing-sql2003-tab2">CREATE TABLE drivers(
  name  VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age   INTEGER <strong>CHECK</strong> (age &gt;= 25 AND age &lt;= 70)
)</pre><p>In JavaScript, we can code an interval constraint in the following
  way:</p><pre class="role-listing-javascript-tab2">Driver.checkAge = function (a) {
  if (<strong>a &lt;</strong> 25 || <strong>a &gt;</strong> 70) {
    return "Age must be between 25 and 70!";
  } else return "";
};</pre><p>In Java Bean Validation, we express this interval constraint by
  adding the annotations <code>Min()</code> and <code>Max()</code> to the
  property <code>age</code> in the following way:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-java-tab2">@Entity
public class Driver {
  @NotNull
  private String name;
  <strong>@Min</strong>(25) <strong>@Max</strong>(70)
  private int age;
}</pre><p>The equivalent ASP.NET Data Annotation is <code>Range(25,70)</code>
  as shown in</p><pre class="role-listing-php-tab2">public class Driver{
  [Required]
  public string name { get; set; }
  [<strong>Range</strong>(25,70)]
  public int age { get; set; }
}</pre></section><section><h3>Pattern Constraints</h3><p>A pattern constraint
  requires that a string attribute's value must match a certain pattern,
  typically defined by a <em>regular expression</em>. For instance, for the
  object type <code>Book</code> we define an <code>isbn</code> attribute with
  the datatype <code>String</code> as its range and add a pattern constraint
  requiring that the <code>isbn</code> attribute value must be a 10-digit
  string or a 9-digit string followed by "X" to the <code>Book</code> class
  rectangle shown in the following diagram.</p><figure> <img
  alt="Class Book with Pattern Constraints"
  src="../fig/Book_ExampleModelWithPatternConstraint.svg" width="340" />
  </figure><p>In an SQL table creation statement, a pattern constraint is
  expressed in a table column definition by appending a suitable
  <code>CHECK</code> clause to the column definition as in the following
  example: </p><pre class="role-listing-sql2003-tab2">CREATE TABLE books(
  isbn   VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL <strong>CHECK</strong> (isbn ~ '^\d{9}(\d|X)$'),
  title  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
)</pre><p>The <code>~</code> (tilde) symbol denotes the regular expression
  matching predicate and the regular expression <code>^\d{9}(\d|X)$</code>
  follows the syntax of the POSIX standard (see, e.g. the <a
  href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/functions-matching.html"
  target="_top" title="PostgreSQL documentation">PostgreSQL
  documentation</a>).</p><p>In JavaScript, we can code a pattern constraint by
  using the built-in regular expression function <code>test</code>, as
  illustrated in the following example:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-javascript-tab2">Person.checkIsbn = function (id) {
  if (!/\b\d{9}(\d|X)\b/.<strong>test</strong>( id)) {
    return "The ISBN must be a 10-digit string or a 9-digit string followed by 'X'!";
  } else return "";
};</pre><p>In Java EE Bean Validation, this pattern constraint for
  <code>isbn</code> is expressed with the annotation <code>Pattern</code> in
  the following way:</p><pre class="role-listing-java-tab2">@Entity
public class Book {
@NotNull
  <strong>@Pattern</strong>(regexp="^\\(\d{9}(\d|X))$")
  private String isbn;
  @NotNull
  private String title;
}</pre><p>The equivalent ASP.NET Data Annotation is
  <code>RegularExpression</code> as shown in</p><pre
  class="role-listing-php-tab2">public class Book{
  [Required]
  [<strong>RegularExpression</strong>(@"^(\d{9}(\d|X))$")]
  public string isbn { get; set; }
  public string title { get; set; }
}</pre></section><section><h3>Cardinality Constraints</h3><p>A cardinality
  constraint requires that the cardinality of a multi-valued property's value
  set is not less than a given <strong><em>minimum cardinality</em></strong>
  or not greater than a given <strong><em>maximum cardinality</em></strong>.
  In UML, cardinality constraints are called <strong><em>multiplicity
  constraints</em></strong>, and minimum and maximum cardinalities are
  expressed with the lower bound and the upper bound of the multiplicity
  expression, as shown in the following diagram, which contains two examples
  of properties with cardinality constraints.</p><figure> <img
  alt="Class Book with Cardinality Constraints"
  src="../fig/CardinalityConstraintsExamples.svg" width="340" />
  </figure><p>The attribute definition <code>nickNames[0..3]</code> in the
  class <code>Person</code> specifies a minimum cardinality of 0 and a maximum
  cardinality of 3, with the meaning that a person may have no nickname or at
  most 3 nicknames. The reference property definition
  <code>members[3..5]</code> in the class <code>Team</code> specifies a
  minimum cardinality of 3 and a maximum cardinality of 5, with the meaning
  that a team must have at least 3 and at most 5 members.</p><p>It's not
  obvious how cardinality constraints could be checked in an SQL database, as
  there is no explicit concept of cardinality constraints in SQL, and the
  generic form of constraint expressions in SQL, assertions, are not supported
  by available DBMSs. However, it seems that the best way to implement a
  minimum (or maximum) cardinality constraint is an on-delete (or on-insert)
  trigger that tests the number of rows with the same reference as the deleted
  (or inserted) row.</p><p>In JavaScript, we can code a cardinality constraint
  validation for a multi-valued property by testing the size of the property's
  value set, as illustrated in the following example:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-javascript-tab2">Person.checkNickNames = function (nickNames) {
  if (<strong>nickNames.length</strong> &gt; 3) {
    return "There must be no more than 3 nicknames!";
  } else return "";
};</pre><p>With Java Bean Validation annotations, we can specify</p><pre
  class="role-listing-java-tab2">
<strong>@Size</strong>( max=3)
List&lt;String&gt; <strong>nickNames</strong>
<strong>@Size</strong>( min=3, max=5)
List&lt;Person&gt; <strong>members</strong></pre></section><section><h3>Uniqueness
  Constraints</h3><p>A <em>uniqueness constraint</em> (or <em>key
  constraint</em>) requires that a property's value (or the value list of a
  list of properties in the case of a composite key constraint) is unique
  among all instances of the given object type. For instance, in a UML class
  diagram with the object type <code>Book</code> we can define the
  <code>isbn</code> attribute to be <em><em>unique</em></em>, or, in other
  words, a <em><em>key</em></em>, by appending the (user-defined) property
  modifier keyword <code>key</code> in curly braces to the attribute's
  definition in the <code>Book</code> class rectangle shown in the following
  diagram.</p><figure> <img alt="Class Book with Uniqueness Constraints"
  src="../fig/Book_ExampleModelWithUniquenessConstraint.svg" width="180" />
  </figure><p>In an SQL table creation statement, a uniqueness constraint is
  expressed by appending the keyword <code>UNIQUE</code> to the column
  definition as in the following example:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-sql2003-tab2">CREATE TABLE books(
  isbn   VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL <strong>UNIQUE</strong>,
  title  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
)</pre><p>In JavaScript, we can code this uniqueness constraint by a check
  function that tests if there is already a book with the given
  <code>isbn</code> value in the <code>books</code> table of the app's
  database.</p></section><section><h3>Standard Identifiers (Primary
  Keys)</h3><p>A unique attribute (or a composite key) can be declared to be
  the standard identifier for objects of a given type, if it is mandatory (or
  if all attributes of the composite key are mandatory). We can indicate this
  in a UML class diagram with the help of the property modifier
  <code>id</code> appended to the declaration of the attribute
  <code>isbn</code> as shown in the following diagram.</p><figure> <img
  alt="Class Book with Standard Identifiers (Primary Keys)"
  src="../fig/Book_ExampleModelWithStandardIdentifier.svg"
  width="180" /></figure><p>Notice that such a standard ID declaration implies
  both a mandatory value and a uniqueness constraint on the attribute
  concerned.</p><p>Often, practitioners do not recommended using a composite
  key as a standard ID, since composite identifiers are more difficult to
  handle and not always supported by tools. Whenever an object type does not
  have a key attribute, but only a composite key, it may therefore be
  preferable to add an artificial standard ID attribute (also called
  <em>surrogate ID</em>) to the object type. However, each additional
  surrogate ID has a price: it creates some cognitive and computational
  overhead. Consequently, in the case of a simple composite key, it may be
  preferable not to add a surrogate ID, but use the composite key as the
  standard ID.</p><p>There is also an argument against using any real
  attribute, such as the <code>isbn</code> attribute, for a standard ID. The
  argument points to the risk that the values even of natural ID attributes
  like <code>isbn</code> may have to be changed during the life time of a
  business object, and any such change would require an unmanageable effort to
  change also all corresponding ID references. However, the business semantics
  of natural ID attributes implies that they are frozen. Thus, the need of a
  value change can only occur in the case of a data input error. But such a
  case is normally detected early in the life time of the object concerned,
  and at this stage the change of all corresponding ID references is still
  manageable.</p><p>Standard IDs are called <em>primary keys</em> in
  relational databases. We can declare an attribute to be the primary key in
  an SQL table creation statement by appending the phrase <code>PRIMARY
  KEY</code> to the column definition as in the following example: </p><pre
  class="role-listing-sql2003-tab2">CREATE TABLE books(
  isbn   VARCHAR(10) <strong>PRIMARY KEY</strong>,
  title  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
)</pre><p>In object-oriented programming languages, like JavaScript and Java,
  we cannot code a standard ID declaration, because this would have to be part
  of the metadata of a class definition, and there is no support for such
  metadata. However, we should still check the implied mandatory value and
  uniqueness constraints.</p></section><section><h3>Referential Integrity
  Constraints</h3><p>A referential integrity constraint requires that the
  values of a reference property refer to an object that exists in the
  population of the property's range class. Since we do not deal with
  reference properties in this chapter, we postpone the discussion of
  referential integrity constraints to <a
  href="https://webengineering.netlify.app/js-firebase/unidir-associations-app/">Part
  4</a> of our tutorial.</p></section><section><h3>Frozen and Read-Only Value
  Constraints</h3><p>A frozen value constraint defined for a property requires
  that the value of this property must not be changed after it has been
  assigned. This includes the special case of <strong><em>read-only value
  constraints</em></strong> on mandatory properties that are initialized at
  object creation time.</p><p>Typical examples of properties with a frozen
  value constraint are standard identifier attributes and event properties. In
  the case of events, the semantic principle that the past cannot be changed
  prohibits that the property values of events can be changed. In the case of
  a standard identifier attribute we may want to prevent users from changing
  the ID of an object since this requires that all references to this object
  using the old ID value are changed as well, which may be difficult to
  achieve (even though SQL provides special support for such ID changes by
  means of its <code>ON UPDATE CASCADE</code> clause for the change management
  of foreign keys).</p><p>The following diagram shows how to define a frozen
  value constraint for the <code>isbn</code> attribute:</p><figure> <img
  alt="Class Book with Frozen and Read-Only Value Constraints"
  src="../fig/Book_ExampleModelWithFrozenValConstr.svg"
  width="200" /></figure><p>In Java, a <em>read-only</em> value constraint can
  be enforced by declaring the property to be <code>final</code>. In
  JavaScript, a <em>read-only</em> property slot can be implemented as in the
  following example:</p><pre class="role-listing-javascript-tab2">Object.defineProperty( obj, "teamSize", {value: 5, <strong>writable: false</strong>, enumerable: true})</pre><p>where
  the property slot <code>obj.teamSize</code> is made unwritable. An entire
  object <code>obj</code> can be frozen with <code>Object.freeze(
  obj)</code>.</p><p>We can implement a frozen value constraint for a property
  in the property's setter method like so:</p><pre
  class="role-listing-javascript-tab2">Book.prototype.setIsbn = function (i) {
  if (this.isbn === undefined) this.isbn = i;
  else console.log("Attempt to re-assign a frozen property!");
}</pre></section><section><h3>Beyond property constraints</h3><p>So far, we
  have only discussed how to define and check <em>property constraints</em>.
  However, in certain cases there may be also integrity constraints that do
  not just depend on the value of a particular property, but rather on </p><ol>
      <li><p>the values of several properties of a particular object
      (object-level constraints),</p></li>

      <li><p>the value of a property before and its value after a change
      attempt (dynamic constraints),</p></li>

      <li><p>the set of all instances of a particular object type (type-level
      constraints),</p></li>

      <li><p>the set of all instances of several object types.</p></li>
    </ol><p>In a class model, property constraints can be expressed within the
  property declaration line in a class rectangle (typically with keywords,
  such as <code>id</code>, <code>max</code>, etc.). For expressing more
  complex constraints, such as object-level or type-level constraints, we can
  attach an <em>invariant</em> declaration box to the class rectangle(s)
  concerned and express the constraint either in (unambiguous) English or in
  the <em><a href="#aside-ocl" title="Object Constraint Language (OCL)">Object
  Constraint Language (OCL)</a></em>. A simple example of an object-level
  constraint expressed as an OCL invariant is shown in <a
  href="#fig1-1"></a>.</p><figure id="fig1-1"><figcaption>An example of an
  object-level constraint</figcaption> <img
  alt="Example of an Object-Level Constraint"
  src="../fig/AuthorConstraints.svg" width="200" /> </figure><p>A general
  approach for implementing <em>object-level constraint validation</em>
  consists of taking the following steps:</p><ol>
      <li><p>Choose a fixed name for an object-level constraint validation
      function, such as <code>validate</code>.</p></li>

      <li><p>For any class that needs object-level constraint validation,
      define a <code>validate</code> function returning either a
      <code>ConstraintViolation</code> or a <code>NoConstraintViolation</code>
      object.</p></li>

      <li><p>Call this function, if it exists, for the given model
      class,</p><ol>
          <li><p>in the UI/view, on form submission;</p></li>

          <li><p>in the model class, before save, both in the
          <code>create</code> and in the <code>update</code> method.</p></li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol></section></body>
