    <title>Responsive Validation</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>This problem is well-known from classical web applications where
  the front-end component submits the user input data via HTML form submission
  to a back-end component running on a remote web server. Only this back-end
  component validates the data and returns the validation results in the form
  of a set of error messages to the front-end. Only then, often several
  seconds later, and in the hard-to-digest form of a bulk message, does the
  user get the validation feedback. This approach is no longer considered
  acceptable today. Rather, in a <em>responsive validation</em> approach, the
  user should get immediate validation feedback on each single data input.
  Technically, this can be achieved with the help of event handlers for the
  user interface events <code>input</code> or
  <code>change</code>.</p><p>Responsive validation requires a data validation
  mechanism in the user interface (UI), such as the <a
  href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/constraintvalidation/"
  target="_top" title="HTML5 form validation API">HTML5 form validation
  API</a>, which essentially provides new types of <code>input</code> fields
  (such as <code>number</code> or <code>date</code>), a set of new attributes
  for form control elements and new JS methods for the purpose of supporting
  responsive validation performed by the browser. Since using the new
  validation attributes (like <code>required</code>, <code>min</code>,
  <code>max</code> and <code>pattern</code>) implies defining constraints in
  the UI, they are not really useful in a general approach where constraints
  are only checked, but not defined, in the UI.</p><p>Consequently, we only
  use two methods of the HTML5 form validation API for validating constraints
  in the HTML-forms-based user interface of our app. The first of them,
  <code>setCustomValidity</code>, allows to mark a form field as either valid
  or invalid by assigning either an empty string or a non-empty (constraint
  violation) message string.</p><p>The second method,
  <code>checkValidity</code>, is invoked on a form before user input data is
  committed or saved (for instance with a form submission). It tests, if all
  fields have a valid value. For having the browser automatically displaying
  any constraint violation messages, we need to have a <code>submit</code>
  event, even if we don't really submit the form, but just use a
  <code>save</code> button.</p><p>See also this <a
