      <li><p>Constraints are logical conditions on the data of an app. The
      simplest, and most important, types of constraints are property
      constraints and object-level constraints.</p></li>

      <li><p>Constraints should be defined in the model classes of an MVC app,
      since they are part of their business semantics.</p></li>

      <li><p>Constraints should be checked in various places of an MVC app: in
      the UI/view code, in model classes, and in the database.</p></li>

      <li><p>Software applications that include CRUD data management need to
      perform two kinds of bi-directional type conversions:</p><ol>
          <li><p>Between the model and the UI: converting object property
          values to UI widget values, and, the other way around, converting
          input widget values to property values. Typically, widgets are form
          fields that have string values.</p></li>

          <li><p>Between the model and the data store: converting model
          objects to storage records (often called serialization), and, the
          other way around, converting storage records to model objects
          (called de-serialization). This involves converting property values
          to storage data values, and, the other way around, converting
          storage data values to property values. Typically, data stores are
          either JavaScript's built-in IndexedDB, cloud databases or
          self-hosted databases, and objects have to be mapped to some form of
          table rows. In the case of an SQL database, this is called
          "Object-Relational Mapping" (ORM).</p></li>
        </ol></li>

      <li><p>Do not perform any string-to-property-value conversion in the UI
      code. Rather, this is the business of the model code.</p></li>

      <li><p>For being able to observe how an app works, or, if it does not
      work, where it fails, it is essential to log all critical application
      events, such as data retrieval, save and delete events, at least in the
      JavaScript console.</p></li>

      <li><p>Responsive validation means that the user, while typing, gets
      immediate validation feedback on each input (keystroke), and when
      requesting to save the new data.</p></li>
