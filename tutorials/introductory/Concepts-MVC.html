    <title>Constraint Validation in MVC Applications</title>
  </head>

  <body><p>Integrity constraints should be defined in the model classes of an
  MVC app since they are part of the business semantics of a model class
  (representing a business object type). However, a more difficult question is
  where to perform data validation? In the database? In the model classes? In
  the controller? Or in the user interface ("view")? Or in all of
  them?</p><p>A relational database management system (DBMS) performs data
  validation whenever there is an attempt to change data in the database,
  provided that all relevant integrity constraints have been defined in the
  database. This is essential since we want to avoid, under all circumstances,
  that invalid data enters the database. However, it requires that we somehow
  duplicate the code of each integrity constraint, because we want to have it
  also in the model class to which the constraint belongs.</p><p>Also, if the
  DBMS would be the only application component that validates the data, this
  would create a latency, and hence usability, problem in distributed
  applications because the user would not get immediate feedback on invalid
  input data. Consequently, data validation needs to start in the user
  interface (UI).</p><p>However, it is not sufficient to perform data
  validation in the UI. We also need to do it in the model classes, and in the
  database, for making sure that no flawed data enters the application's
  persistent data store. This creates the problem of how to maintain the
  constraint definitions in one place (the model), but use them in two or
  three other places (at least in the model classes and in the UI code, and
  possibly also in the database).We call this the <strong><em>multiple
  validation problem</em></strong>. This problem can be solved in different
  ways. For instance:</p><ol>
      <li><p>Define the constraints in a declarative language (such as
      <em>Java Bean Validation Annotations</em> or <em>ASP.NET Data
      Annotations</em>) and generate the back-end/model and front-end/UI
      validation code both in a back-end application programming language such
      as Java or C#, and in JavaScript.</p></li>

      <li><p>Keep your validation functions in the (PHP, Java, C# etc.) model
      classes on the back-end, and invoke them from the JavaScript UI code via
      XHR. This approach can only be used for specific validations, since it
      implies the penalty of an additional HTTP communication latency for each
      validation invoked in this way.</p></li>

      <li><p>Use JavaScript as your back-end application programming language
      (such as with NodeJS), then you can code your validation functions in
      your JavaScript model classes on the back-end and execute them both
      before committing changes on the back-end and on user input and form
      submission in the UI on the front-end side.</p></li>
    </ol><p>The simplest, and most responsive, solution is the third one,
  using only JavaScript both for the back-end and front-end components of a
  web app.</p></body>
