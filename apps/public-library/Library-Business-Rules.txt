A valid Austin Public Library Card is required to borrow materials. 

Library materials may not be checked out to an account if there are overdue items currently checked out, fees exceeding $24.99, the account is expired, or if the account is not in good standing.

A maximum of 50 items can be checked out at one time.

The loan period is 3 weeks, allowing two renewals (unless another customer has placed a hold on the item or the account is not in good standing).
Austin Public Library items may be renewed two times, except for items that have holds placed on them by other customers

When items are renewed, the new due date is calculated from the date of the renewal.

There is a 15 hold limit on a valid Austin Public Library card at one time.

Holds can be placed as long as the account is in good standing.

Holds not picked up or not canceled within the 10 calendar day hold period will be assessed a $1 fee per item.
